## What's Interesting

The rise of AI as a tool for software engineering has become increasingly scary for SWEs, especially entry level ones like new graduates, and an announcement like this from a major company like Salesforce is quite alarming. Hiring trends in big tech have been very volatile over the past few years, with the giant surge of SWE hires coming off of the pandemic and then the subsequent overcorrection that led to layoffs and hiring freezes, so AI coming into the mix only makes things more unpredictable. The article notes that Salesforce already laid off about 10% of their workforce in 2023, citing overhiring during COVID, so it could be said that it was obvious that they would head in this direction, but we will have to wait and see if this becomes a larger trend in tech. 

With the recent Deepseek development, I am very interested to see how companies view AI moving forward, as it has in my opionion become a bit of a bubble where every company is shoehorning it into products to inflate their stocks, which they are now feeling the repercussions of as Deepseek gains traction as a free, open source AI that can be run locally. Even though articles like this can be scary for computer science students and SWEs, I think it is important to remember that software engineering is still a hot market and a CS degree can take you in many directions like data science, cybersecurity, and quant so we should not lose hope.
